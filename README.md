# Terminal Portfolio

A single-page, terminal-style personal site built with React + Vite. Fork it, drop in your details, and publish to GitHub Pages in a few minutes.

- Prerequisites: Node 18+ and pnpm (`npm i -g pnpm`).
- Fork this repo on GitHub, then clone your fork: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/failuresmith/terminal && cd terminal`.
- Install and run locally: `pnpm install && pnpm dev` (open the shown localhost URL).

## Customize your copy

- **Commands & content:** Edit `src/components/terminal/defaultCommands.ts` to change text, links, or add/remove commands.
- **Blogs/notes:** Replace markdown in `src/data/blogs` and `src/data/logs`; both surfaces are exposed through the `blogs` terminal command.
- **Downloads:** Put files in `public/files` and list them in `src/data/fileManifest.json`.
- **Branding:** Tweak colors/typography in `src/global.css`. The landing intro lives in `src/hooks/useTerminalController.ts`.

## Notifications & telemetry

- The app can send lightweight JSON notifications to an ntfy.sh topic at `https://ntfy.sh/terminalTSX`. This is used for observability (e.g., logging terminal actions).
- A reusable hook, `useTelemetry`, posts structured events with action name, user input, and optional error details/stack traces. Plain messages are also supported.
- To point to your own ntfy topic, set `VITE_NTFY_TOPIC_URL`; to disable outbound telemetry entirely, set `VITE_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` in your environment.
- ntfy.sh is a third-party service; avoid sending secrets or sensitive personal data. Messages are transmitted as JSON over HTTPS by default.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (recommended)

Current workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` automatically deploys to github pages, you just need to enable it if it's not:
1. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Source = “GitHub Actions”. Pages will publish to `https://<username>.github.io/terminal/`.
2. `pnpm run build` writes `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` into `dist/`. Set a repository variable named `SITE_URL` when using a custom domain or non-default Pages URL so sitemap URLs are canonical.
3. For a project Pages URL under `/terminal/`, submit `https://<username>.github.io/terminal/sitemap.xml` directly in Search Console. Host-root robots discovery requires control of `https://<username>.github.io/robots.txt`.

## Useful scripts

- `pnpm dev` – start the site locally
- `pnpm build` – production build to `dist/`
- `pnpm preview` – serve the build locally
- `pnpm test` – run the Vitest suite

## Need more?

- Deeper technical notes live in `docs/technical-details.md`.
- If you changed the repository name from `terminal` to anything else, pages would fail to load assets, double-check the `base` path in `vite.config.js` matches your repository name.
